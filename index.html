    <p class="sectionTag">Calculating the area of a home you plan to buy</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag">Carpet Area: According to the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Carpet area is the net usable floor area of an apartment, excluding the area covered by external walls, the area under utility shafts, exclusive balcony, or verandah area, and exclusive open terrace area. The carpet area includes the area covered by the internal partition walls of the home. </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p class="sectionSubTag">Built-up area: The built-up area of a home is measured at the external perimeter wall surfaces. It is made up of the carpet area plus the wall thickness and other non-usable areas within the apartment such as the dry balcony, terrace, flower beds, etc. It is always greater than the carpet area. Built-up area is carpet area + area of walls </p>
    &nbsp;
    <p class="sectionSubTag">Super built-up area: The super built-up area is the saleable area, which includes the carpet area, the terrace, balconies, areas occupied by walls, and area occupied by shared structures (e.g. lift, stairs, etc). In some cases, builders include amenities such as a pool, clubhouse, and garden. Builders use the carpet area load factor to arrive at the super-built-up area. Super built-up area = Built-up area + common areas</p>
